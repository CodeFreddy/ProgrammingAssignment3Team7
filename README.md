# ProgrammingAssignment3Team7
This is my contribution on programming assignment 3.
Because I met some problems when I tried to push my code to Xin's repository, so I just sent my code to Xin and he merged my code with his part on his local machine then pushed all code to his Github. 

bnn.bnn and lnc.ltn were implemented in independent different files, Spearman's Corelation was part of Main.java, I just extracted my part and put it into SpearMan_Corelation.java
